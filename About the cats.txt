About The Cats

#1 – Tebi
Colour: Brown and Grey
Likes: Warm Places
Tebi is easily distracted, but so is every other cat in the race so she's not really special.

#2 – Huge 
Colour: Purple
Likes: Frogs
Despite his name, huge is the no bigger than any other cat in the race.

#3 – Sam
Colour: Orange
Likes: Mouse Toys
Was meme'd out of retirement and now greatly regrets it.

#4 – Cairo 
Colour: Yellow and Blue
Likes: Napping
Her unique colors and stripes give off an air of royalty, although some people think the stripes are painted on.

#5 – Jeremy
Colour: Beige and Black
Likes: Biting
Jeremy can't be trusted.

#6 – Meringue 
Colour: White
Likes: Breaking Bad
It is a cruel irony that she is called Meringue as she can’t eat sweets on account of being a cat, and also diabetic.

#7 – Baron
Colour: Grey
Likes: Being Pet
“When I grow up, I want to be a Doberman!”

#8 – Train
Colour: Black
